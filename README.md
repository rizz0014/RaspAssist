# RaspAssist - Noodles

This project was created by ***[Guilherme Rizzo](https://rizz0014.github.io/)*** to study Python and the use of Sense Hat.

#### What is Sense Hat?

"The Sense HAT is an add-on board for the Raspberry Pi, made especially for the Astro Pi competition. The board allows you to make measurements of temperature, humidity, pressure, and orientation, and to output information using its built-in LED matrix."

You can find more information [HERE](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-sense-hat). 

## Learning Objectives

* Python anatomy
* Types and values
* Conditionals and operators
* Building loops
* Defining functions
* Python data structures: lists, tuples, sets, and more
* Creating classes
* Handling exceptions
* Working with strings
* File input/output (I/O)
* Object Oriented Programming model (OOP)
* Integrating a database with Python db-api

#### Sense Hat

* Displaying Text
* Displaying Images
* Creating animations
* Sensing the environment
* Using joystick 

### Snake Assistant - "Noodles"

The snake assistant displayed on the Sense Hat is called "Noodles" and it was created to perform some functions:

* Cheer you up
* Display the room Temperature, Humidity and Pressure every 15 minutes
* Notify when the room temperature > 27 C or humidity < 30%
* If room temperature or humidity is out of the comfortable zone Snaky will change its colour
* Remember you the lunch time and Night time

#### Noodles Friends

Noodles has some friends to catch your attention to some important moments of the day:

* Lunch time - Kirby
* Night time - Pikachu

### Sense Hat Dashboard

All the Sense Hat data is stored at:

* Data is posted at dweet.io (https://dweet.io/follow/rizz0014sense)
* Dashboard is on the freeboard.io. (https://freeboard.io/board/dkP3-h)

### Display Routines

Snaky and his friends was configured to display the routines below:

* Cheer you up - every 5 minutes
* Room data - every 15 minutes
* Lunch time - daily at 11:30am, 12:30pm and 1:30pm
* Night time - daily from 8pm to 00am (every hour)

## Contact

Please fell free to give suggestions and collaborate with the project!

As an entry-level programmer I would appreciate your constructive criticism, I'm in a constant learning process.

Happy coding!
