# this file is to create a package, that will initialized all the files / modules inside the "util" folder

# To use you still need to import into the project, and a good practice is to still describe everything that is imported
# EX: from util import file1, file2

# or using alias (as)

# from util import file1 as file1
# from util import file2 as file2
